# AWS System Manager support for Datadog on `_PLATFORM-NAME_`

*New Platform Support TODO*

* Create a new folder under `/platforms` for your platform. Use lowercase and
    hyphenate multiple words. For example `amazon-linux`.
* Copy this file into your new platform folder as `README.md`, and after completing the next
    steps update your readme as per notes below. For example,

    ```
    cp ./TEMPLATE_PLATFORM_README.md ./${PLATFORM_NAME}/README.md
    ```
* Copy `aws-ssm-install-datadog-agent-TEMPLATE.yaml` into your platform folder replacing `TEMPLATE` with your `PLATFORM_NAME`.
* Edit template
* 

## Enter your PLATFORM_NAME

* Maintain build status - :white_check_mark:, :x:, or use your imagination.
Keep it updated.
* Enter contact information for maintainer
